        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a Pre-Business Major, who is deciding to concentrate in Marketing as well as minoring in Computer Science. I have been an A student all throughout High School and knew what career i wanted to pursue. As in now i am a first year in an University of California getting passed my first quarter of the year<br><br>

       I was born in the United States, however I am Mexican, French, and Spanish. Sometimes I also think i might be Russian, because many people confuse me with being Russian instead of Mexican when they see me at first glans. I have grown up and lived in various places in california, went to multiple schools throughtout my childhood and best of all, I have met so many different people with different mindsets. I love traveling and meeting different people. seeing what life is like in different parts of the world is something that blows my mind. my favorite part of traveling the world is that you can see amazing things, like monuments and old statutes. you learn more about history and traditions that they had. I haven't traveled around the world as much as i wish too, but i am definetly looking forward to it. I have visited multiple parts of Mexico, Starting with Mazatlan Sinaloa. I have also traveled to Paris France, Aswell as Rome Italy, Venice Italy, and Florence Italy.<br><br>

       Though I might be young I have been able to become trilingual. I speak fluent Spanish which was my first language, as well as fluent English, however i learned English at 13 years old, once I moved from Mexico to the US again. I can also communicate and understand somewhat in French, I am still in the learning process. I can understand some words in Russian and a couple in Farci. I plan of learning over 5 languages at someopoint in my life since i find languages so facinating. Something insteresting is that I am a fan of Video Games and proceffional car racing events. I love the adrenaline and have came to find out amusement parks are my favorite places to go and have fun with family and friends. I am really good at understanding Math but my favorite subjects is Chemistry, because of the experiments we are able to do and History, because I find the accion in Ancient wars and Revolucionary wars so interesting. i enjoy helping others and working with many people, having a good and happy work environment as well. I am a fast learner and can manage to multitask specially in work under preassure environments. I am a very understanding person and can always help to find solutions for many things despite the fact they dont affect me. I am caring of others but I always put my priorities first.
